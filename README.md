---
## Steps:
* Open termux and go to folder location where you have downloaded the codes of voice assistant using `cd fileLocation`.
* Now use `python main.py`.
* If any error occurs check it carefully and install the required package/python module and try again.

## Error that you can face:
* It may give you hard time to give storage and microphone access to your termux app so you can use `termux-storage-setup` and also you can try to record something using [Termux microphone record](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-microphone-record) then you can make it work.

## Conclusion:
* It is easy to make a voice asssistant for android too.
* Android has some default python modules installed as it's also a linux based device.
